# Holiday-Planner
A website which will generate ideas for a holiday destination based on the user's inputs. The user can then use the website to draft a day-to-day itinerary, with three top picks for places to stay nearby the events listed on the plan.

I made this website because I am planning a holiday of my own, and I want to make the process easier by generating ideas over what to do based on my preferences. I think it could be an extremely useful tool, as it increases the convenience of the user not having to write an extremely long prompt, as well as it being reusable. So I thought this would be a good idea to help improve my web development skills.

This is my second website, so I struggled a lot with CSS, specifically over centering and resizing pages so it could fit on a phone screen, for example. Learning how to use the div element and flexboxes definitely helped this. The second thing I struggled with was JavaScript, as I had never used it to call an API before, so it was an interesting learning curve.
